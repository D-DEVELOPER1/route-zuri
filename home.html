        <h1>A Homepage Worth Visiting</h1>
        <p>The homepage of your site is the first introduction each visitor
             will have to your business. Before they make up their mind to become a customer,
              theyâ€™ll review your homepage to get an idea of what you sell, why that matters to them,
               and how they can benefit from what you have to offer.

            Make a brilliant first impression with a homepage that incorporates
             the elements outlined above. And for more inspiration, check out stunning examples
